         Muscle Growth and Strength Training. 
         By now it is common knowledge that resistance training is the most efficient way to build muscle and strength.
          Understanding how and why your muscles operate is very important to giving each muscle the proper attention.
           Your muscles are what you use to manage the environment around you.
            Our bodies are constantly adapting to the environment around us because that's what nature does.
             Your muscles are no different. Each style of resistance training will invoke a different response to how your muscle adapt and grow in the environment they are in. If you're training for a marathon you adapt your leg muscles to work for long stretches of time. 
             If you're training for a 100 meter dash you adapt your leg muscles for quick explosive movements.
              Now apply that same logic to resistance training.

        You Can Grow Your Muscles

        <p>
        by focusing on strength training and endurance training. 
        To get stronger in your lifts, its important to put your body under extreme tension with heavier weight. 
        Lower reps ranging from 4-6 reps will improve your strength and allow you to lift heavier weight over time. 
        However, it is also important to incorporate endurance training. Training with reps ranging from 8-12 will allow your muscles to endure the stress from the weights for a longer period. Balancing both these concepts will help strengthen your muscles and gradually grow them in size.

            To Avoid Injuries When Lifting Weights
        </header>
        <p>
        keep your form tight. Ego lifting and bad form is the number 1 way to slow your progress and keep you from reaching your goals. 
        It is important to have experienced lifters help by watching your form and range of motion. 
        Many of us don't do well with criticism or being corrected, however lifting heavily on a consistent basis is not something to take lightly. 
        There are very big risks to resistance training when done improperly and you don't want to be a victim to long term injuries. 
        In my experience, I would constantly get shoulder pains that would prevent me from training consistently and would cause me to have to stop lifting for weeks on end. 
        I eventually swallowed my pride and corrected my bench form, and even though I had to start off with lowering my weight, I haven't had shoulder issues since.

        Warm Up. Drink Water. Stretch.
        </header>
        <p>
        It is important to warm up your muscles to prepare them for high stress you will be soon putting on your muscles. 
        Imagine you turn on your car and immediately floor the gas. This would obviously not be a smart thing to do so treat your body the same way.
         Warming up prepares your muscles with increasing the blood flow into the muscle preventing any cramps or tears. Drink water consistently but in small increments. Imagine water as the engine oil for your car. Not drinking enough water when training could cause serious injury to your muscles that you could simply avoid by staying hydrated. Stretch your muscles and joints before and after your lifts. 
         It helps avoid injuries and aches that you could experience during and after your lifts. I even like to move my limbs around between sets just to keep them nice and mobile throughout my workout. Stretching helps improve your range of motion and overall improves the performance of your lifts. It also aids in recovery and overall makes your training experience more pleasant and safe.

        My Advice To What Specific Lifts To Do is
        </header>
        <p>
        to use the equipment that focus on all the different angles that specific muscle your are targeting. In my experience it is difficult to apply workouts that are too specific because not everyone goes to the same gym with the same equipment. But what I can tell you is that you can find equipment that targets all the angles in which that muscles moves. Research the different ways you can target a muscle group and see if any of those movements can be replicated with the machines and equipment offered in your gym.
