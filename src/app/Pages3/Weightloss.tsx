      <header>WEIGHT LOSS</header>
         <p>Losing weight is simple. Imagine your body is a car. A car takes in gas and in turn 
            burns it to make the vehicle move. Just like a car you are constantly consuming and using energy during the day. As you could guess, consuming energy would be from what you eat and drink, and using energy is from every bodily function you do. Energy can not be created or destroyed, however when it comes to the human body, 
            it can be stored. When you pour gas in your car you can obviously only store up to the maximum capacity of the car’s gas tank. Just like a car, the human body has a “maximum capacity” to energy consumption, called “maintenance”. Your maintenance is how much energy you need to consume on a daily basis. This can be calculated easily online.

        However, if you proceed to consume more energy than your body needs, it stores it aside. The storage of energy is what we know as body fat. 
        When you consume more energy than your body needs, it builds fat to use later when you lack enough energy throughout the day. In order to burn that fat stored in your body, you need to consume below maintenance.

        Let’s Do Some Simple Math...
        </header>
        <p>
        ...There are 3,500 calories in a pound of fat. If you eat 500 calories below maintenance every day for a week, you burn 1 pound of fat. Below is a list of food items that add up to around 500 calories:
            McDonald's Big Mac, 4 slices of Bacon,
            Starbucks Venti Carmel Frap, and 2 full size Snicker Bars.
            I recommend cutting 500-700 calories from your maintenance everyday to manage your cut. Any more calories could lead to unhealthy behaviors that I strongly recommend avoiding.
            Get familiar with the calories in the meals you have, and start to keep track of what you've eaten throughout the day. Many apps today have features to help you do just that.

        One of the Reasons Most People Struggle With Losing Weight...
        </header>
        <p>
        ...could be traced to how we interact with food today. In many cases, we find ourselves eating simply for leisure. Our typical reaction to hunger is to eat. However, what if the “hunger” we are feeling is simply a craving. Our bodies aren’t aware of how we balance our meals throughout the day, therefore when you consume food, your body isn’t aware of the next opportunity it would get to eat. This is why sometimes you find yourself hungry again even if you had a decent meal not to long ago. To help with my cutting goals, I reassociated how I see food, not as a leisure, but as fuel. That doesn’t however mean that I don’t enjoy my meals, I simply align them with my body’s needs. The next time you find yourself “hungry”
         think about what you ate already that day, and when you’re planning on eating again. If your hunger isn’t justified, then consider holding off on eating. After a short while of approaching your diet like this you would notice a change in your cravings. In my personal experience, I noticed a drop in cravings and even thoughts of eating throughout the day.

        WEIGHT LOSS CHEAT CODES:
        </header>
        <p>
        1. Caffeine, Caffeine, Caffeine. Caffeine is used as a stimulate for many people everyday for work, the gym, or simply to start their day. 
        However, when it comes to weight loss caffeine can work as a hunger blocker. Drinking caffeine throughout the day helps keep you from feeling hungry and keeps you energized throughout the day. This however does come with a catch. Be selective on what caffeinated drinks you consume. A Starbucks signature latte with 100 grams of sugar isn't what I mean. There are many ways to consume caffeine however I would advice to limit your consumption as many caffeinated drinks have unhealthy components to them.

        2. Avoid excess sugar. Sugar is one of the most detrimental substance to a person's weight loss journey for multiple reasons. Sugar is high in calories and not very filling. In other words you can eat a lot of sugar before feeling full yet consume an absurd amounts of calories. Worst of all your body builds a tolerance to sugar. If sugar is a regular ingredient in your foods and drinks you would eventually need more and more to gain the same satisfaction. Cutting out sugar can be very difficult and I too crave a donut or a cupcake every once in a while.
 The best way I lowered my daily sugar intake was to slowly add less and less sugar to my coffee to eventually only need a dash of milk. My tolerance lowered tremendously and now I can enjoy sweets without needing to add more and more sugar. I don't recommend cutting out sugar from your life entirely since that could lead to higher cravings that would be very difficult to ignore and potentially having you fall back into the same routine.

        3. Drink lots of water. There are many reasons why anyone should consider increasing their water intake but in terms of weight loss it can play a major role in our food consumption.
         Drinking water fills up space in your stomach making you feel more full more often. Some tips I've managed to implement in my life is to have a glass of water when I eat my meals especially when eating out. Servers regularly bring out a glass of water to you whenever you first arrive and best of all its free! I would try and finish that glass of water before my food arrives in order to eat less of my food that I ordered, and even better I got leftovers for later that night. Drinking water throughout the day would also help silence those cravings so I recommend to always carry some water with you wherever you go.

         4. Avoid snacking. Like I said before most of us treat food as a leisure and that keeps us from being able to reduce our caloric intake. Many times I've noticed people claim to cut out carbs, sugar, or whatever their dietary tactics are to reduce their weight.
          However, they don't account for the snacking they do throughout the day. Even a "healthy" snack can amount to 150-400 calories which can sometimes put you over in terms of calories. Worst of all snacking doesn't even make us full. Instead of using those 150-400 calories for the few seconds of satisfaction, you could make your meals more filling and nutritious.
