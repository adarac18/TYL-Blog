      <header>LIFE BALANCE</header>
         <p>I personally was never one to sacrifice the more enjoyable things in life for my fitness goals. I managed to find a way where I can do both! ITS ALL ABOUT BALANCE.
            Balance in my opinion is the key to living a fulfilling life. I truly believe that you can build a physique you are proud of without having to give up on fun nights with your friends or experiencing the world. If you feel this way too then you've come to the right place.

        is by keeping a well rounded schedule. If you already have your days scheduled out great! Find time between your priorities to fit in a few hours for the gym. If you have a 9-5 work schedule you can either go to the gym before work or right when you get off.
         If you find yourself struggling to fit in a couple hours for the gym there are workouts that can take you just 30-45 minutes and be just as effective

        Another effective way to achieving your goals is to keep track of the foods you eat. Keeping track of your food will help keep you aware of the amount of calories you are consuming a day.
         Even if it's just a simple snack it is always important to know what habits you make when it comes to your daily caloric intake. There are many apps online you can download for free and begin tracking your food with ease.

            The YoungLifeStyle tips:

        <p>
        1. Give yourself proper breaks. Burnout is inevitable in anything we do.
         To avoid burning yourself out in the gym, give yourself not just proper rest, but a break from the fitness world. Indulging every once in a while keeps you feeling fresh and ready to go whenever you're back in the gym.

        2. Workout with a friend. Many of us struggle sometimes with motivation or staying consistent with our goals. However, with a consistent gym partner it can be more encouraging to workout and sometimes more fun!
         It might even bring out a competitive spark which will only lead to better results in the long run.

        3. Have fun. If you can enjoy your workouts and meals you would have a much easier time finding the balance in your life.
         Get yourself some nice gym outfits, makes friends in the gym, and learn delicious recipes that would fit your macros. The gym can be a very enjoyable part of your daily routine if you let it.
